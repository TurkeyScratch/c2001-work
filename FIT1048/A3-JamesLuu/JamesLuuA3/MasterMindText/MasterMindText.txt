 A white-faced figure appears on screen. As it speaks,
 the jaw moves like a child was controlling it, or rather
 a psychotic engineer.

 "Hello there, I want to play a game.

 Fixed onto your skull is a death-trap. To disarm it, you 
 will have to figure out a combination of colour letters 
 on the wired tablet in front of you.

 The death-trap can be as painful as a:
   [0] Stinger     (Standard, 10 attempts, 4 letters, 
                    6 selections)
   [1] Amputator   (Hard, 13 attempts, 5 letters,
                    8 selections)
   [2] Decapitator (Very Hard, 15 attempts, 6 letters, 
                    9 selections)

 Every time you get the combination wrong, a set of 
 spikes will move closer towards your head. If you run
 out of attempts, the spikes will then dig into your
 brain (and you LOSE the game).

 The only mercy you will get is markings on the tablet.
   '!' means you have the right letter and position.
   '?' means the right letter, but incorrect position.
   No markings means that the letter isn't there at all.

 You may also beg for a [c]lue (up to 3), accept your
 [f]ate, play t[h]is recording again or [q]uit the game.

 Live or die. Make your choice."
