A white-faced figure appears on screen. As it speaks,
the jaw moves like a child was controlling it, or rather
a psychotic engineer.

"Hello there, I want to play a game.

Fixed onto your skull is a death-trap. To disarm it, you 
will have to figure out a random combination of letters 
on the wired tablet in front of you.

Every time you get the combination wrong, a set of 
spikes will move closer towards your head. 
If you run out of attempts, the spikes will have dug 
into your brain (meaning you LOSE).

The only mercy you will get are markings on the tablet,
they will NOT be in order of where you put the letters.
  '!' means you have a correct letter and position.
  '?' means the correct letter, but the wrong position.
  '_' means that a letter isn't there at all.
  
The death-trap can be as painful as a:
  [0] Stinger     (10 attempts, 4 letters, 6 selections)
  [1] Amputator   (13 attempts, 5 letters, 8 selections)
  [2] Guillotine  (15 attempts, 6 letters, 9 selections)

You may also beg for up to three [c]lues, accept your
[f]ate, play t[h]is recording again or [q]uit the game.

Live or die. Make your choice."
