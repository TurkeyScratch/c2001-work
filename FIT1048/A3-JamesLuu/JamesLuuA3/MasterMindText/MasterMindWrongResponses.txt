"You have guessed... incorrectly."
"Wrong!"
"Escape is futile."
The device is getting closer...
*Buzz* ... *Creak*
...
Time is running out.
You wonder if you can escape the room without losing your brain. Or your mind.
The device retracts its spikes... closer towards you.
...
A deep voice cackles in the distance. You almost thought that it was a hyena.
*Crack* You thought you had it, but the spikes have not given up.
You can feel the spikes tingling in your head. It's amazing how your brain still works.
You're in the endgame now.
